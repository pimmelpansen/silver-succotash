Transfer Scout
=========================

In the tab “Squad”, you can simulate a player by “Skilltester”. In this
module, you can save your simulation player for later use.

There’s two way

**1**. you use new style and “Enable copy to clipboard” is checked under
“Appearance” in “Site Preferences” on Hattrick.

-  Go to the page of a player over 17 years in hattrick, and use the
   button copy from Hattrick “C” top right of the page.

**2**. “Use classic pages” is checked under legacy settings in your
“Site Preferences” on Hattrick.

-  Go to the page of a player over 17 years in hattrick, and copy the
   entire page: CTRL+A (to select the whole page) then CTRL+C (to copy
   it to the clipboard).

This also works with the Youth Academy provided they have the required
age to enter in senior.

**Then**. they are for you to paste this information (CTRL+V) into
“Paste Playerdata” and click on the appropriate button “Apply”.

**The buttons:**

-  **Add** : Add to list simulated player

-  **Replace list item** : Select a player from the list, change the
   features and update it

-  **Remove list item** : Delete the selected player list

-  **Remove all player** : Resetting the player list

-  **Mini-Scout** : Reduced mode of this module

-  **Add player** : Add your selected player to your squad to see its
   contribution to your team; When you will restart HO!, the player will
   no longer be present but you can add it again through this module.

**NB : The language in HO and in hattrick must be the same for use this
module**

**NB2** : Don’t forget that loyalty and mother club bonus will be reset
if you buy such a player.
